# BSL Practice 
### Overview
This is a project I have been making to help those learning BSL to practice efficiently. All the words used on the page come from British Sign UK's introduction to BSL course. I also wanted to do this so I could relearn HTML and explore Javascript and CSS as I had never used them before this.
### Features
Light and Dark Mode: Offering 2 different modes allows the user to choose a mode which benefits them based on their surroundings and preferences. The dark mode can also help save battery on old OLED screens as it consumes less power, it also allows for more efficient practice before bed as it emits less blue light which can negatively effect the eyes.  
Camera: The camera allows you to easily see what you are signing to check if you are correct when you compare it to the video links in BSL dictionary.  
Links to BSL Dictionary: All the random word generators have links to the page in BSL dictionary which is the largest online collection of BSL words.
### The Coding
FOr this I used the light WSGI web application framework Flask 3.1(https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)and python 3.11.9 to create the server side. The I used bootstrap to add visuals, all the pages are coded in HTML with CSS for the styling and Javascript for the interactivity. I used docker files and microsoft azure to turn it into an actual webpage that could be accessed from any device. It can be ran on any sized device but the visuals were specifically made for a computer/laptop or phone.
